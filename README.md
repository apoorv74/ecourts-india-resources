### eCourts

The digitization of Indian courts began with the [eCourts project](https://ecommitteesci.gov.in/project/brief-overview-of-e-courts-project/). The Indian judiciary comprises of nearly 15,000 courts situated in approximately 2,500 court complexes throughout the [country](https://www.meity.gov.in/content/e-courts). Access to data generated from these courts is important for transparency, accountability and better public policy. But in the absence of open API's it is hard for citizens to get access to these datasets. In the past few years, there have been a few attempts to study the judicial processes by scraping data from the eCourts platform. This repository contains a collection of published datasets, articles and reports. You can refer to these resources if you are planning to work on data from eCourts. 

Scraping data from eCourts is a resource intensive process and most people who have worked on eCourts have often cited issues with the data quality. So a better approach might be to review the datasets linked in this repo or to get in touch with the people who have worked on these projects before you plan on curating more data for your study.

Refer to the [datasets](datasets.md) and the [writings](writings.md) page to access the links.
